As always, read and understand Chapter 22, then answer these questions
in "answers.txt". 

1.  What is the main idea of binary search?

    A.  Search for two things at once.
    B.  Split the problem in half at each step.
    C.  Order the items, so you can search efficiently.
    D.  Searching a tree is always efficient.
    E.  None of the above

2.  What do you call a node with no children?

    A.  Orphan node
    B.  Leaf node
    C.  Root node
    D.  Lonely node
    E.  None of the above
    
3.  When is a tree balanced?

    A.  It has exactly the same number of nodes on all paths from the
        root to null.
    B.  All levels are fully filled in, except possibly the last one
        (in which case all nodes on the last level must be filled in
        from left to right). 
    C.  Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
    D.  Every node's children differ in height by at most one.
    E.  None of the above

4.  What is the worst case access time to find a particular value in a
    binary search tree with N nodes? 

    A.  O(1)
    B.  O(lg(N))
    C.  O(N)
    D.  O(N^2)
    E. None of the above

5.  A (balanced) binary search tree can be used to implement a map or
    set ADT. What restriction is placed on the keys?

    A.  The keys must be a totally ordered type.
    B.  There cannot be duplicate keys.
    C.  The keys must be numeric types.
    D.  The key for the root must be zero.
    E.  None of the above

6.  When you add to a binary search tree, the new node is inserted:

    A.  At the root
    B.  As a child of the root
    C.  As the parent of a leaf node
    D.  As a leaf node
    E.  None of the above

For questions 7-10, construct a binary search tree by adding the
following items (in this order) to an empty tree: 
9, 7, 81, 4, 32, 16, 99, 1, 6, 22

7.  What are the leaf nodes in the resulting tree?

    A.  1, 7, 32, 99
    B.  1, 6, 7, 22, 81
    C.  1, 4, 7, 9
    D.  4, 16, 32
    E.  None of the above

8.  What node is 32's left child?

    A.  4
    B.  9
    C.  16
    D.  22
    E.  None of the above

9.  What is the height of the tree (count a leaf node as height 1)?

    A.  4
    B.  5
    C.  6
    D.  7
    E.  None of the above

10. Which set of operations would make the tree full?

A. Remove 99, insert 8
B. Remove 22, insert 35
C. Remove 6,  insert 191
D. Remove 1,  insert 25
E. None of the above
