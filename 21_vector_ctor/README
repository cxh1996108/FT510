In this short assignment, you will add constructors to the Vector2D
class you previously defined.

First, copy vector.cpp and vector.hpp from the vector_2d assignment
into this directory.

Your only task is to modify your class in vector.hpp and vector.cpp to
have two different constructors, described below.

  1.  Define the default constructor, which sets both x and y to 0.
  2.  Define a constructor that takes in two arguments representing
      the x and y coordinates of the vector and initializes x and y.

You may comment out initVector, as you will no longer need it. Make
sure you use an initializer list.
