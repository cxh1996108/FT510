Comments from your grader:
Really nice job generating test cases of your own.
Abstractionwise, main is a little long. Consider moving option processing to 
its own function (and check out how getopt sets optind). Classes are good, but 
why are Portfolio's fields public? Use size_t for size. UnrestrictOptimal and 
RestrictOptimal aren't part of the parsingâ€”consider encapsulating these in 
the Portfolio or creating an Optimizer class (also prefer these to be 
lowercase).
Names are good, but pay attention to case conventions, and consider improving 
readability for variables like "A" and "t."
Formatting has a few indentation irregularities. Consider working in Emacs or 
running clang-format on your code before submitting.
Documenting features within functions is good, but should also give more 
information about what each function does and what a Portfolio is. For this 
program, documenting the linear algebra operations is especially important, as 
this is complicated.
Recommend running 'make clean' before adding to git. 
Overall, really good work, but there are opportunities to improve OO and a few 
other things.
                                                         [8.5/10]
