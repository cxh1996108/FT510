    D.  rooted
    E.  None of the above

3.  What is the heap ordering rule for a min heap?

    B.  Every node is larger than its children.
    C.  The left child is smaller, and the right child is larger.
    D.  Every level has as many nodes as possible, and the last level
        is filled in from left to right.
    E.  None of the above
    
For questions 4-7, consider the max heap created by adding the
following items (in this order) to an empty heap: 

9, 3, 15, 99, 1, 7, 12, 6

4.  When you inserted 6, it had to be swapped with:

    A.  1
    B.  7
    C.  1 then 3
    D.  3
    E.  None of the above

5.  In array form, the final heap is:

    A.  3  6  15 99 1  7  12 9
    B.  3  9  7  1  6  12 15 99
    C.  99 12 9  7  1  15 6  3
    D.  99 15 12 6  1  7  9  3
    E.  None of the above

6.  If you were to remove the maximum element, what element would
    temporarily become the root, and need to be bubbled down?

    A.  1
    B.  6
    C.  9
    D.  12
    E.  None of the above
    
7.  If you were to add a new element to the original tree (without
    having done the removal in question 3), under what condition would
    it need exactly two swaps as it bubbles up?

    A.  It is between 7 and 12
    B.  It is between 15 and 99
    C.  It is greater than 99
    D.  It is less than 3
    E.  None of the above

8.  What property does Huffman coding exploit to compress data?

    A.  Spatial Locality
    B.  Different Frequencies of Symbols
    C.  Abstraction
    D.  Gaussian Distribution of Hash Results
    E.  None of the above

9.  Huffman compression finds an optimal encoding where...

    A.  Each symbol is encoded in 6 or 7 bits.
    B.  You are guaranteed to compress the data by at least 10%.
    C.  No symbol's encoding is a prefix of another's.
    D.  Each symbol's encoding includes an error correction bit.
    E.  None of the above

10. The Huffman compression algorithm uses what two data structures? 

    A.  A linked list and a heap
    B.  A linked list and a binary search tree
    C.  A hash table and a priority queue
    D.  A priority queue and a binary tree
    E.  None of the above
