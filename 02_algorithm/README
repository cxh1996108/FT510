This problem is intended for you to practice the basics of algorithmic
development and execution by hand that you learned in Chapter 1.

Here is what you need to do:

 (1) Find a partner.  
 (2) One of you should do problem 1.7 from AoP [page 45]
     The other should do problem 1.8 from AoP  [page 45]
 (3) Notice that step [3] of each problem asks you to give your
     algorithm to your partner. When you both finish writing your
     algorithm and executing it for N=6, swap with your partner.
     Execute your partner's algorithm and compare answers.
     Did you get the same answers? Was something ambiguous in the
     algorithm? Did you find the patterns correctly?
 (4) After you finish, create a file in this directory called
     "answer.txt" and write the answer to 1.8 in that file. For
     example, if the answer was for N=5 (instead of N=6), you would
     write on one line:

     -25 -24 -21 -16 -9 0 11 24 39 56 96 119 144 171

     After you have done that, save the file, add it to git, commit
     it, push it, and request it to be graded (if you do not remember
     how, look back at 00_submit).
