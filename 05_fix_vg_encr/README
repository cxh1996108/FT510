In this assignment, you are going to work on a Ceaser Cipher
encryption program that reads an input file and writes encrypted
output to an output file. The output file name is ".enc" appended to
the input file name (for example, if your input file is called
"input.txt", it will write to "input.txt.enc"). 

This program, which is is included in encrypt.c, has the basic
algorithm correct, but makes a variety of errors---all of which
valgrind will detect. Your job for this problem is to fix the program
by making it valgrind cleanly. 

Hint: Start from the first valgrind error. Read and understand the
      error. It will tell you on what line of code valgrind detected
      the problem. To understand the error and why it is occuring,
      drawing some pictures will likely help. Fix the error, make, and
      re-run. Repeat the process until all valgrind errors are
      gone. Don't forget that gdb may be useful as well.
